## Dependency Management

Kinsta automatically installs dependencies defined in your `composer.json` file, during the deployment process.

## Web Server Setup

### Port

Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should **not** hard-code it into the application.

### Start Command

When deploying an application, Kinsta automatically creates a web process running `heroku-php-apache2`.

## Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit) the `composer install` command is run.

## What is Leaf PHP
